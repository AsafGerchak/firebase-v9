# Notes on Firebase version 9 with realtime database

Hi there! This repo is some content to help understand Firebase version 9, currently specifically using it in Create React App (and with similar bundlers) to access Firebase's realtime database service.

This content is intended primarily for the community of [Juno College](https://github.com/HackerYou) (hi friends! 👋🏽) but of course I'm happy if other people find it useful! As of time of writing (Sept. 2021), Firebase's docs are... not awesome? Especially for realtime DB on v9, so I made this repo!


## What's in here right now

Not much! Just two JS files, [atFirstIWasLike.js](./atFirstIWasLike.js) and [butThenIWasLike.js](./butThenIWasLike.js) which show, respectively, the old (version <9) and new (version 9+) ways of initializing, configuring, reading and writing a Firebase realtime database. I recommend opening the two files side-by-side in split screen view to see how things are done in each instance.

Maybe I'll add more to this repo! Maybe I won't! Look I've got a lot going on, my time is pretty busy, there's a lot of snacks to get through in here ok?? I love snacks.
